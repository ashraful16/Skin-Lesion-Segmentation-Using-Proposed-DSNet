# DSNet: Automatic Dermoscopic Skin Lesion Segmentation

Through this study, we present a new and automatic semantic segmentation network for robust skin lesion segmentation named Dermoscopic Skin Network (DSNet). In order to reduce the number of parameters to make the network lightweight, we used a depth-wise separable convolution in lieu of standard convolution to project the learnt discriminating features onto the pixel space at different stages of the encoder.
